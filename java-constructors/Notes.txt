in java, object creation is 2 step process

step-1 : dynamic memory allocation   : new
step-2 : fill that memory with obj's default/given values : constructor

imp-notes:

--> by default every java class has 1 default constructor (d.c )
	when no constructor written by you

--> D.C assign default-values to obj's variables


-->	to create an object with mandatory properties,
   	we shud write our own constructor with args
   
--> when we write our own constructor, then default wont exist   

--> to create an object in many ways i.e with different params,
    we can overload constructors ( i.e we can write many constructor in same class )
    
    
    coding rules for overloaded-constructors
    
    must be different
    
    --> in number of arguments
    
    or
    
    --> type of arguments
    
    or
    
    --> order of arguments
